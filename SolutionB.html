        <h1>The Returned Disco Ball</h1>
 
        <p>You drown the rest of your worries away in the whisky. You fall asleep at the dance hall, and upon waking, you find that the disco ball was back in its rightful place. 
            Was last nightâ€™s investigation all just a dream? You feel that there was more to it, but you decided to let it go. Sometimes hidden things are meant to stay hidden.

            THE END
