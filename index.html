            “Detective, there’s been a case and we need your help.”
            You are called by the party organizer and have been asked for help. You are asked to solve the case of the Missing Disco Ball!! You start by looking around the surroundings and see that the dance floor is empty and the diamond disco ball is missing from its place. 
            Suddenly, you hear a commotion in the distance. You look around and see another crowd on the other side of the room. But then, something catches your eye. You see a door that is slightly ajar, with rays of purple light shining through.
