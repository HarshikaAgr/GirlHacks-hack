            Thereâ€™s been a case and we need your help. You look around the surroundings and see that the dance floor is scarce and the usual disco ball is missing from its place. 
            Suddenly, there is a loud commotion in the distance. You look around and see another crowd on the other side of the room. But then, something catches your eye. You see a door that is slightly ajar, with rays of purple light shining through.
