        <h1>Investigation: Case Closed</h1>
 
        <p>
            As you walk towards the building, you see a glint of light sparkle through the tinted windows. You have found the disco ball! You rush inside and find that a party full of the lower and middle class people has been going strong while the party at the dance hall was starting to quiet down. 
            You talked to a masked man, someone that seemed to be held with high regard and they explained what was happening: “You see, these people are the backbone of this city. Without them, the whole city would crumble. There would be no one to man the shops, fix our buildings, nurse the sick, and everything in between that. 
            I wanted to celebrate their efforts, soI felt that it was only appropriate to let them experience the best disco party in the city for free.” Through his mask, you saw a pair of shockingly clear gray eyes filled with sincerity. The man speaks again. “Of course, I will return the disco ball in due time.” 
            He gave a wink, and you decide to tell the party organizer that you didn’t find the disco ball. The next day, the disco ball was in its rightful place and the dance hall owner was left scratching his head. Did all of them drink too much last night? That is something that only you and the phantom thief would know.

            THE END
