        <h1>The Forever Lost Disco Ball </h1>
 
        <p>You kept investigating around the dance hall with no success. You kept a keen eye on your surroundings. You didn’t stop, not even until the sun began to peek through the trees, washing the city with light. 
            You went back inside the dance hall, and the disco ball was still missing. You sigh in disappointment and frustration and tell the party organizer the bad news. The disco ball was lost forever. You hear the disco gods clicking their tongue at you. 
            “Life is far too short to be this vigilant. Maybe if you let loose, this mystery would have been solved.” 

            THE END
        </p>
